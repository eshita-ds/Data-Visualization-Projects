# Extinguished Lights: A Visual deep dive into Infant Mortality

## Introduction
Infant mortality refers to the tragic loss of babies before their first birthday, a global issue affecting societies regardless of geography or socio-economic status. While advancements in medicine have reduced such cases, infant mortality remains a vital indicator of community health and well-being.

Studying its causes is crucial for uncovering immediate factors and deeper systemic issues, such as regional patterns, socio-economic influences, and healthcare disparities. This knowledge helps develop targeted interventions to address root causes effectively.

With access to extensive global data, this research aims to analyze not just the prevalence of infant mortality but also the factors driving it. The ultimate goal is to equip policymakers, healthcare professionals, and communities with actionable insights to reduce infant mortality and promote healthier outcomes for the world's most vulnerable.

## Data Overview
I used three datasets for my analysis, with "Child and Infant Mortality" as the primary source. This dataset contains statistics on infant mortality across various years and countries, comprising 35 files, of which I focused on five:

- Causes of Death in Children
- Child Deaths by Age
- Child Mortality around the World
- Child Mortality by Sex
- Per Capita Health Expenditure vs. Infant Mortality

Additionally, I used two other datasets for country-specific data: Country-wise GDP and World Population.
To understand the data structure and identify cleaning needs, I imported the sheets into Python using pandas for a quick overview. However, I chose to perform data cleaning manually to better visualize and manage modifications during the integration process.


### Cleansing & Preparation
I analyzed details about the basic structure of each file and type of cleaning required for each
of them before starting with the visualizations. I decided to use the Tableau Prep builder
over Python for the same as it would be easier to visualize my data while cleaning and joining
it. My final data flow from Tableau prep builder is as follows. I generated a Tableau specific (.hyper) file to be used an input data source to Tableau for my visualizations.

### Visualization
Infant mortality, a critical indicator of a society's health and well-being, continues to be a
focal point of global concern. In this series of dashboards, we delve into the intricate
landscape of infant mortality, employing a comprehensive approach that combines data
from various sources. My visualizations aim to illuminate trends, patterns, and critical factors
that influence infant mortality rates across regions and over time.
